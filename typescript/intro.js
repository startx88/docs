/**
 * What is typescript:
 * It is super set of javascript with static type system.
 *
 * Typescript = Javascript + Type System
 *
 * The TS Tyep System:
 * 1. Help us catch errors during development.
 * 2. Uses type anotations to analyze our code.
 * 3. Only active during development.
 * 4. Doesn't provide any performance optimization.
 *
 *
 *
 * How code works:
 * Write Typescript code (JS with type annotations)
 * Typescript compiler
 * Convert Plain old js
 *

/**
 * Interface:
 * interfaces in typescript used to define the structure of an object.

/**
 * Runtime behavior:
 * TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript.
 *
 * ex:
 * Vividing by zero in JavaScript produces "Infinity" instead of throwing a runtime exception.
 * Note: As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.
 */

/**
 * Erased Types: Roughly speaking
 * 1. Once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code.
 * 2. It erases the types to produce the resulting “compiled” code.
 * 3. This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information
