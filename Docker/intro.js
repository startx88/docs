/**
 * What is docker:
 * It is a plateform for developer and system admin to build, run and share application
 * with containers.
 * the use of containers deploy applications is called containerization.
 * Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers.
 *
 * Docker has two types of containers:
 * 1. Linux containers
 * 2. Windows containers
 *
 * Default is linux containers, when i say containers i mean linux
 *
 * Docker Server: Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.
 * Docker Client : Tools that we are going to issue commands to
 *
 * Containers:
 * It is runtime instance of an image, runs a program.
 *
 * docker run hello-world
 *
 * run = docker create hello-world + docker start hello-world
