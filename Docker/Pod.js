/**
 * Kubernetes Pods:
 * A pod is the basic execution unit of kubernetes application
 * -- the smallest and simplest unit in the kubernetes object model
 * that you create or deploy.
 *
 * A pod represent process running on your cluster.
 *
 * Pod encapsulates an application's container (in some cases multiple containers),
 * storage resources, a unique network identity (IP address) as well as options
 * that govern how the container(s) should run.
 *
 * A pod represents a unit of deployment: a single instance of and
 * application in kubernetes
 *
 * Docker is the most common container runtime used in a kubernetes,
 * but pods support other container as well.
