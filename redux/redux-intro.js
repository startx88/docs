/**
 * What is redux: is a state container for javascript application (single page application)
 *
 * 1. Redux is a predictable store container for js apps
 * 2. It helps to write applications that behave consistantly, run in any environment (client, server and native)
 *
 * It has below methods:
 * 1. applyMiddleware : you add third party redux supported library here
 * 2. bindActionCreators :
 * 3. combineReducers : crate multiple reducer to combine on root reducers
 * 4. compose :
 * 5. createStore : use to create store  it has several methods
 *    a. dispatch : this method use to dispatch an action (simple js object with predefine info and payload)
 *    b. getState : this method use to display the store state
 *    c. subscribe :
 *    d. replaceReduceer
 *    e. Symbol(observable)

/**
  * Create your own createStore
  const createStore = reducer => {
        let state;
        let listeners = [];

        const getState = () => state;

        const dispatch = action => {
          state = reducer(state, action);
          listeners.forEach(cb => cb());
        };

        const subscribe = listener => {
          listeners.push(listener);
          return () => {
            listeners = listeners.filter(l => l != listener);
          };
        };

        dispatch({});
        
        return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };

/**
 * 
 * How exactly compbineReducer works:
 * 
 * 1. using reducer composition object
      const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
          return {
              counter: counter(state.counter, action),
              todos: todos(state.todos, action),
              visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)
          };
      }
      const store = createStore(todoApp);


   2. implementing combineReducers
      const combineReducers = reducers => {
          return (state = {}, action) => {
            return Object.keys(reducers).reduce((nextState, key) => {
              nextState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action);
              return nextState;
            }, {});
          };
      };
};
