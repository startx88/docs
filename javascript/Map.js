 * What are maps:
 * 1. It is similar to object.
 * 2. The map hold key, value pair and remember origional insertion order of the keys.
 * 3. Any value (both object or primitive ) use as key or value
 * 4. A map object iterate its elements in insertion order  - a For..Of loop returns and array of [key, value] for each iteration.
 * 5. Key equality is based on the "sameValueZero" algorithm.
 * 6. NaN is considered the same as NaN (even though NaN !== NaN)
